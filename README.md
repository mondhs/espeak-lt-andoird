----------

This branch contains the files needed to build espeak on the android platform.
It is derived from the eyes-free project.

## Build Dependencies

In order to build eSpeak, you need:

1.  a functional autotools system (`make`, `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`
    and `pkg-config`);
2.  a functional c++ compiler;
3.  wxWidgets development libraries (needed to build and run espeakedit
    to compile the phoneme data).

In order to build the APK, you need:

1.  the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) with API 21 support;
2.  the [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html);
3.  Gradle 2.1.

In order to use Android Studio, you will also need:

1.  [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).

### Debian

| Dependency    | Install                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| autotools     | `sudo apt-get install make autoconf automake libtool pkg-config` |
| c++ compiler  | `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`                                   |
| wxWidgets     | `sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev`                           |
| gradle        | [gradle-2.1_0ubuntu1_all.deb](https://launchpad.net/~cwchien/+archive/ubuntu/gradle/+files/gradle_2.1-0ubuntu1_all.deb) |

## Building

### Building with Gradle

1.  Set the location of the Android SDK:

        $ export ANDROID_HOME=<path-to-the-android-sdk>
2.  Build the project:

        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ ./configure --with-gradle=<path-to-gradle>
        $ make

This will create an `android/build/outputs/apk/espeak-release-unsigned.apk` file.

### Signing the APK

In order to install the built APK you need to self-sign the package. You can do
this by:

1.  Creating a certificate, if you do not already have one:

        $ keytool -genkey -keystore [YOUR_CERTIFICATE] -alias [ALIAS]
2. Sign the package using your certificate:

        $ jarsigner -sigalg MD5withRSA -digestalg SHA1 \
          -keystore [YOUR_CERTIFICATE] \
          android/build/outputs/apk/espeak-release-unsigned.apk [ALIAS]
3. Align the apk using the zipalign tool.

        $ zipalign 4 android/build/outputs/apk/espeak-release-unsigned.apk \
          android/build/outputs/apk/espeak-release-signed.apk

## Installing

Now, you can install the APK using the `adb` tool:

    $ adb install -r android/build/outputs/apk/espeak-release-signed.apk

After running, `eSpeakActivity` will extract the `espeakdata.zip` file into its
own data directory to set up the available voices.

To enable eSpeak, you need to:

1.  go into the Android `Text-to-Speech settings` UI;
2.  enable `eSpeak TTS` in the `Engines` section;
3.  select `eSpeak TTS` as the default engine;
4.  use the `Listen to an example` option to check if everything is working.
